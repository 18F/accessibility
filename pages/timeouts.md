If timeouts are used, you must give the user at least 20 seconds to request more time. 

### Testing 

1. Identify any timeouts on the page
  * Contact the developer to find these
2. Trigger the time out
  * __If you are not able to request more time or the request lasts less than 20 seconds, its a failure__

### Examples

#### Passes

Fill out this form

<form id='pForm'>
<label for='t1'>Field 1</label>&nbsp;<input type='text' id='t1'><br>
<label for='t2'>Field 2</label>&nbsp;<input type='text' id='t2'><br>
<label for='t3'>Field 3</label>&nbsp;<input type='text' id='t3'><br>
<label for='t4'>Field 4</label>&nbsp;<input type='text' id='t4'><br>
<label for='t5'>Field 5</label>&nbsp;<input type='text' id='t5'><br>
</form>

> This passes becuase a timeout does occur, but you are given more than 20 seconds to request more time.
