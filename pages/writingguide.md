### The Law

Section 508 is part of the 'Rehabilitation Act of 1973.' The law was amended in 1998 to add 508 which requires that government agencies provide equal access to infromation to disabled employees.

The correct way to refer to the law is: 

* Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. ยง 794 (d))
* Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act
* Section 508

While related in ways, the Rehabilitation Act is not part of the Americans with Disabilities Act. 

### Key Words

* <b>Conformance:</b> We confrom with the standards of Section 508, not the law of section 508.

* <b>Compliance:</b> A government agency is in compliance with the law.
