This checklist helps developers identify potential accessibility issues affecting their websites or applications. It's broken down into three sections of decreasing import: A, B and C. Please check and address these issues in the order in which they appear. 

 * A - Critical issues that will cause serious issues for users of assistive technology
 * B - Less critical issues that can be overcome by most assistive technology
 * C - Minor issues that only affect ease of use with assistive technology

It is important to note, while B and C are noted as less critical, they are still required to be truly 508 compliant. This checklist should be used as a reference for development and is not a substitute for compliance checks by a section 508 coordinator.

###  A - Critical

1. <a href='../keyboard'>Site is keyboard accessible</a>
 * All interactions can be accessed with a keyboard
2. <a href='../keyboard'>Site is free of keyboard traps</a>
 * The keyboard focus is never trapped in a loop
4. <a href='../forms'>All `form` inputs have explicit labels</a>
6. <a href='../images'>All relevant images use an `img` tag</a>
5. <a href='../images'>All images have `alt` attributes</a>
6. <a href='../multimedia'>Multimedia is tagged</a>
 * All multimedia has appropriate captioning and audio description

### B - Less Critical
1. <a href='../color'>Text has sufficient color contrast</a>
 * All text has a contrast ratio of 4.5:1 with the background
2. <a href='../keyboard'>Site never loses focus</a>
 * Focus is always visible when moving through the page with the keyboard
3. <a href='../keyboard'>Tab order is logical</a>
4. <a href='../forms'>Form instructions are associated with inputs</a>
5. <a href='../timeouts'>Site doesn't timeout unexpectedly</a>
 * Identify elements that may "timeout" and verify that the user can request more time
6. <a href='../tables'>Tables are coded properly</a>
 * Tables have proper headers and column attributes
7. <a href='../headings'>Headings are nested properly</a>
 * Heading elements are nested in a logical way

### C - Minor
1. <a href='../frames'>Frames are named</a>
 * All frames have a name element
2. <a href='../flashing'>Flashing elements are compliant</a>
 * Elements that flash on screen do so at a rate of less than 3hz
3. <a href='../properties'>Language is set</a>
 * The language for the page is set
 * The language for sections on the page that differ from the site language are set
4. <a href='../css'>CSS is not required to use the page</a>
 * The page makes sense with or without CSS
5. <a href='../links'>Links are unique and contextual</a>
 * All links can be understood taken alone, i.e 'Read more - about 508'
6. <a href='../pagetitles'>Page titles are descriptive</a>
7. <a href='../plugins'>Required plugins are linked on the page</a>
