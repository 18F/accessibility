Flashing is generally a bad idea. It can cause all sorts of issues, from seizures to motion sickness. If you absolutely must have a flashing element there are a few things to consider.

### Testing

* Failure at any step constitutes a 508 compliance issue

1. Look for elements that contain flashing
  * Scrolling or blinking text
  * Scrolling or blinking page elements
  * Videos that contain flickering or flashing
  * GIFs that contain flickering or flashing
2. Check if you can determine the frequency of "flashing."
3. Check that the rate of flashing is less than 3 Hz (3 times a second), or scroll delay is set to >= 400.

### Examples

#### Fails
<button type='button' id='blinkbutton'>Click to see non-compliant flashing</button>
<span class='blink' style='display:none;'>This text is blinking</span>

> ___Failure:___ This blinking text fails because the rate of flashing can't be determined and its greater than 3 Hz.
