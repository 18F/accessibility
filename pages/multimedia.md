When using multimedia, we must provide means for everyone to consume the media. Multimedia is anything that uses audio and video

### Closed Captioning

Videos with audio require synchornized closed captioning. Anything said in the video must be included in the closed captioning, and anything in the closed captioning must be said in the video. 

### Audio Description

Audio description ensures any information displayed visually is conveyed via audio. The most basic example of this is text on screen. All the text on screen should be availble by audio. This can be done a couple of ways. The script for the video can be written in a way that all visual information is read by the narrator. The other way is to add a seperate audio track that describes the visual content. This can be done with a special player or a seperate version of the video with the audio baked in. 

### Keyboard Access

Just a note about keyboard access. All video controls should be accessible via the keyboard, but its also worth noting the time stamp information should be availble to screen readers aswell.
