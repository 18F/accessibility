Plugins provide extended functionality not native to the browswer. Examples include PDF, Flash, Shockwave, Silverlight, and Java. 

Anytime one of these is used on a page, they must be tested for accessiblity. 

Pro-tip: Flash always fails for accessibility, but is often given an exception. 

### Testing 

1. Identify any plugins on the page
2. Identify a link to download each plugin
3. Check each plugin for accessibility
  * Most plugins have a VPAT availble on the manufactures website which lists its accessilbity findings
