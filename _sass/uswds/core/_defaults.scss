// XXX This file has been deprecated in favor of _variables.scss, and is no
// longer relevant. Instead, set any variables that you wish to override, then
// @import '{path/to/uswds/}core/variables';

// For backwards compatibility with consumers of _defaults.scss, we just
// re-import _variables here. This should be a noop if it has already been
// imported, since every variable is declared with `!default`.
@import './variables';
