# Accessibility
This repo will contain the guidelines and best practices for 508 accessibility at 18f. 
The site is in draft.

### Running Locally 

The site is `jekyll` based, and will require the Ruby gem to run. 

  * `gem install jekyll`

To keep our code updating continuously as we edit, we use `jekyll serve --baseurl '' --watch`. As of Jekyll 2.2.0, [gh-pages compiles Sass natively](https://github.com/blog/1867-github-pages-now-runs-jekyll-2-2-0).
